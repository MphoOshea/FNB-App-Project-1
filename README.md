FNB App Academy – Week 1 & 2 Project
This project is part of my learning journey through the FNB App Academy, created during Week 1 of the program. The main objective was to learn the basics of HTML by creating a simple multi-page website about different modes of transportation. In Week 2, CSS was added to improve the look and feel of the pages.

Project Overview
The project includes informational pages on:
Index
Plane
Plane 2
Truck
Yacht
Boats
Cable Cars
About Us
Each page is built using HTML, and styled with CSS (linked via styles.css). It demonstrates basic structure, semantic tags, internal navigation, and simple multimedia integration (images).

Pages
index.html – Home Page that serves as the main entry point.
plane.html – Overview and information about planes.
plane2.html – Additional content on aircraft, possibly with a different focus or layout.
truck.html – Details about trucks, their uses and features.
yacht.html – Information about yachts and luxury water travel.
boat.html – Educational content and an image of boats.
cablecar.html – Descriptions and examples of cable cars.
